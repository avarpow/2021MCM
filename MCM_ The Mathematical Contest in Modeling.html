  <li class="style2">Registration process has been streamlined and split into 2 parts: Advisor Registration and Team Registration.</li>
  <li class="style2">The MCM/ICM Contest now have a 25 page limit. The 25 page limit applies to the entire submission including the Summary Sheet, Solution, Reference List, Table of Contents, Notes, Appendices, Code and any problem specific requirements.</li>
  <li class="style2">Due to the Covid-19 virus teams are encouraged to meet virtually using electronic communications. BUT, your team members may only communicate with members of their own team. The rule remains that teams may not use any persons, other than their own team members, to discuss or obtain ideas for working on and solving their problem.<br>

</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>The 2021 MCM/ICM contest period runs between 5:00 p.m. EST Thursday, February 4, 2021 and 8:00 p.m. EST on Monday, February 8, 2021.    </li>
  <li>Each team may consist of a maximum of three undergraduate (or below) students enrolled full- or part-time at the same school/institution at the time of the contest. Teams may consist of 1, 2, or 3 students and each student may only participate on one team.</li>
  <li>Each team must have an advisor who is a staff member, a faculty member, or a student at the team members’ institution. Advisors can serve more than one team. Advisors must register teams prior to 3p.m. EST on Thursday, February 4, 2021.</li>
  <li> Teams must obtain and use the Control Number and password assigned to them at registration to participate in MCM/ICM.</li>
  <li>Not later than the opening of the contest window, advisors must assign team members to a particular team, and cannot add or change student assignments for the duration of the contest. Teams may, however, remove a team member, if he or she decides not to participate.</li>
  <li>Once the contest window opens (5:00 p.m. on Thursday, February 4, 2021), <strong>team membership must be set and teams may not use any persons, other than their own team members, to discuss or obtain ideas for working on and solving their problem.</strong> Teams <strong><u>may</u></strong> use any "inanimate" resource they find on their own such as: web pages, books, articles, research reports, databases, etc. Teams <u><strong>may not</strong></u> seek help in obtaining answers, ideas, or information, or in locating appropriate resources, from any persons outside of their team to include their advisor, other teachers, other students, and/or experts or professionals in a field relevant to the problem. This restriction includes personal or telephonic contact, as well as use of electronic social media such as, but not limited to: emails, texting, chat rooms, question-answer systems, interactive blogs, Twitter, Weibo, online help or support sites, etc. Additionally, posting or sharing any part or all of the problem statement, your team’s solution process, or any partial or complete work in any form or medium during the contest is strictly prohibited. COMAP will disqualify or deem unsuccessful any team that violates this rule. The relevant issue is one of intent: each team of students is expected to develop all of its substantive analysis and solution without the help of others.</li>
  <li>Teams must document any outside sources of information by using footnotes, endnotes, or in-line documentation, and include appropriate citations in a reference list or Bibliography of these sources.</li>
  <li>Teams choose to work on one problem (MCM: A, B, or C or ICM: D, E, or F) and submit one solution for the problem of their choice.</li>
  <li>The names of the students, advisor, and/or institution must not appear on any page of the solution. The solution must not contain any identifying information other than the team Control Number.</li>
  <li>Papers must be submitted as an Adobe PDF electronic file, and typed in English, with a readable font of at least 12-point type. Papers must be within the 25 page limit.</li>
  <li>Upon closing of the contest window at 8:00 p.m. EST Monday, February 8, 2021, advisors must ensure each team makes no further changes to their solution paper. Advisors must then ensure all solution documents are properly prepared and sent via email to COMAP for judging no later than <strong>9:00 p.m. EST Monday, February 8, 2021</strong>.</li>
  <li>COMAP follows all accommodations relative to learning conditions for individual students used as part of the local school/institution program in an affected student's daily learning. If specialized staff is required, the school bears the responsibility for providing any specialized assistance as required by law. If such accommodations are required for a student participating, the school should detail them and the extent to which they were utilized as part of the MCM/ICM activities.</li>
  <li>COMAP reserves the right to disqualify or reduce the award level of teams found to have violated the contest rules.</li>

  </b>The registration fee for MCM/ICM is $100 per team. Please register only the teams that will take part in the contest. Registration fees are non-refundable. We accept payment via Credit Card, and payment must be made via our secure web site. Our secure site will process your credit card payment, so your credit card number is protected. Our system will not store your credit card number after it processes your payment. We regret that we are not able to accept other payment forms at this time.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal3"><strong>All teams must be registered before 3:00 p.m. EST on Thursday, February 4, 2021.</strong> We recommend that all teams complete the registration process well in advance, since the registration system will not accept any new team registrations after the deadline. COMAP will not accept late registrations for MCM/ICM 2021 <strong>under any circumstances. NO EXCEPTIONS WILL BE MADE.</strong> <em>Note: Advisors do not have to designate specific team members when registering "a team." COMAP suggests you register the number of teams needed well prior to the deadline and then return to the contest site once team membership is set to enter specific students to each "Control Number" team you have registered.</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal3">The 2-part registration process will take advisors through a series of screens that ask for an email address and contact information. Enter the required information as you step through the screens. <strong>Be sure to use a valid current email address</strong> so that we can use it to contact you at any point before, during, or after the contest, if necessary.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>All Registration Activity:  </strong><a href="https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/index.html">https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm.</a> COMAP will accept no other forms of registration. Advisors may register any number of teams, and should use the same email address and password for all teams under the same advisor.</li>
  <li><strong>Advisor Registration:</strong> If you are an advisor entering the contest site for the first time for the 2021 contest, click on <strong><a href="https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/register.php">Register for Contest</a></strong> on the left-hand side of the screen to register as an Advisor. Enter your email and click Continue Advisor Registration. Follow the step to continue and finish your registration. <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Be sure to use a valid and current email address as you will use this email to register all of your teams, and communicate with COMAP. Additionally, COMAP will use this email to contact you at any point before, during, and after the contest, if necessary.</li>
  <li><strong>Register a Team or Teams:</strong> On contest site, click on <a href="https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/login.php"><strong>Advisor Login</strong></a>, then log in with the same email address and password that you used when you registered as an advisor. Once you are logged in, click on <strong>Register Team</strong> near the upper right corner of the page and follow the instructions there. <strong>There is no restriction on the number of teams an advisor can register.</strong><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	Fill in billing information. After we receive approval from your financial institution (this takes only a few seconds), the system will issue a control number for your team.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	Each team is not officially registered until you have received a team <strong>control number for that team</strong>. The registration page also lists the email address and password that you entered when registering; you will need this information to complete the contest procedures. <strong>Make a record of each team control number.</strong> You will <strong>NOT</strong> receive an email confirmation of your registration.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.	You may specify the team members at the time of registration, or at a later time. Advisors may assign team members to specific teams and control numbers up until the beginning of the contest period. Once the contest opens, team members cannot be added or changed. The spelling of all names and institutions is the responsibility of the advisor. This is exactly as they will appear on certificates. The order of the student names has no bearing or importance on participation. In the eyes of COMAP and the contest directors,all team members are equal.Advisors should ensure they spell team members’ names correctly when registering. COMAP will not reprint certificates. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.	To register additional teams, repeat the procedures listed above.</li>
  <li>If you need to change any of the advisor or institution information (name, address, contact information, etc.) that you specified when you registered, you can do so at any point before or during the contest by logging in to the contest web site with the same email address and password that you used when registering (click on the <a href="https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/login.php"><strong>Advisor Login</strong></a> link on the left side of the screen). Once logged in, click on the <strong>Edit Advisor or Institution Data</strong> link near the upper right corner of the page.</li>

    <a href="http://www.immchallenge.org/mcm/index.html" target="_blank" class="style1">http://www.immchallenge.org/mcm/index.html</a><br>
    If you cannot access any of the sites, there may be a problem with your local Internet connection. Contact your local Internet service provider to resolve the issue.</li>
  <li>Each registered team may choose any one of the six problem choices and should submit a solution to only one problem.<br>
    <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	MCM problems are Problem A, Problem B or Problem C.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	ICM problems are Problem D, Problem E or Problem F.</strong></li>
  <li>Teams may use any inanimate source of data, materials, computers, software, references, websites, books, etc. Teams should reference all sources used using footnotes, endnotes, or in-line documentation, and include an associated reference list citing all sources.</li>
  <li>Teams may not seek help from any person outside of team members as delineated in the Contest Rules (specifically Rule #6).</li>
  <li>Teams should keep in mind the following guidelines when solving the problem and developing their solution.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. <strong>Summary Sheet: </strong>The summary is an essential part of your MCM/ICM paper and should appear as the first page of your solution report. The judges place considerable weight on the summary, and winning papers are often distinguished from other papers based on the quality of the summary. <a href="https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/flyer/MCM-ICM_Summary.docx" target="_blank">Click here to download the Microsoft Word Summary Sheet</a> or <a href="https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/flyer/MCM-ICM_Summary.tex" target="_blank">Click here to download the LaTeX Summary Sheet.</a><br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	To write a good summary, imagine that a reader will choose whether to read the body of the paper based on your summary: Your concise presentation in the summary should inspire a reader to learn about the details of your work.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	You should write the summary last, as it should clearly describe your approach to the problem and, most prominently, your most important conclusions. Ensure you plan time after solving your problem to write a comprehensive and articulate summary.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Summaries that are mere restatements of the contest problem, or are a cut-and-paste boilerplate from the Introduction are generally considered to be weak.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. <strong>Overall:</strong> The team’s solution should be articulate, concise, and organized in order to allow the reader to easily follow the solution process and conclusions. Key statements should present major ideas and results.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	A Table of Contents assists the reader in previewing the organization of your report.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Present a clarification or restatement of the problem as appropriate.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Present a clear exposition of all variables and hypotheses.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	State and justify reasonable assumptions that bear on the problem.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Present an analysis of the problem, motivating or justifying the model being used.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Summarize derivations, computations, or illustrative examples in the main body of the solution, and leave lengthy derivations and/or calculations and data in appropriate appendices.
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Include a design of the model. Discuss how the model could be tested, to include error analysis, sensitivity, and/or stability.<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •	Discuss any apparent strengths or weaknesses to your model or approach.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Provide a conclusion and report results explicitly.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Document resources and references.</li>

  </ol>
<p><strong>During the Contest – Preparing a Solution Document</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>MCM/ICM solutions are judged as varying degrees of successfully completing the contest (from Successful Participant up to Outstanding). There is no passing or cut-off score, and therefore, partial solutions are acceptable and teams are encouraged to complete as much of the problem as they are able to do. MCM/ICM judges are primarily interested in the team’s thought processes, analysis of the problem, modeling approaches, and mathematical methods.</li>
  <li>Teams must submit their entire solution in one <strong>Adobe PDF</strong> electronic file, consisting of written text, figures, charts, and supporting materials. Papers must be typed in English, with a readable font of at least 12-point type. Do not send additional “non solution” files such as data or computer programs.</li>
  <li>Each page of the solution must contain the team control number and the page number at the top of the page. Use a page header on each page - for example: <strong>Team # 214321, Page 6 of 25</strong>.</li>
  <li>Your solution report should start with the Summary Sheet followed by the team’s solution. <span class="style2">Ensure your solution meets the 25 page limit requirement.</span> A Table of Contents is encouraged and does count toward the page limit. Reference list (or Bibliography), notes pages, and any appendices now count toward the page limit and should be included after the solution pages.</li>
  <li>Names of the students, advisor, and/or institution <u><strong>must not</strong></u> appear on any page of the solution. The solution file <u><strong>must not</strong></u> contain any identifying information other than the team Control Number.</li>
  <li>STOP making any changes to the solution at <strong>8:00pm EST on Monday, February 8, 2021</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>During the Contest – Advisor Activities
  </strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>After the contest begins at 5 p.m. EST on Thursday February 4, 2021, and while the teams are preparing their solutions, the advisor should login to the contest web site at <a href="https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/index.html">https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm</a>.

    <li><strong>MCM Awards (Problem A, B and C)</strong></li>
    <li>The Ben Fusaro Award will be accorded to an especially creative paper and will be chosen from the contest finalists.</li>
    <li>The  Frank R. Giordano Award began in 2012.  It honors Brig. Gen. (ret) Frank Giordano who directed the MCM for 20 years. This award goes to a paper that demonstrates  true excellence in the execution of the modeling process.</li>
    <li><strong>ICM Awards (Problem D, E and F)</strong>
    </li><li>The Leonhard Euler Award is presented to a team selected by the head judge of the ICM's Problem D.   The criteria are:  1) a paper in the Meritorious/Finalist/Outstanding rating; 2) contains especially creative and innovative modeling; and 3) shows good understanding of interdisciplinary science.   The award honors the name of a 18th-century Swiss applied mathematician, who was known for the breadth of his research applications, volume of written work, excellent teaching, and interdisciplinarity. </li>
    <li>The Rachel Carson Award honors an American conservationist whose book "Silent Spring" initiated the global environmental movement and whose work spanned many disciplines concerned with the local and global environments.  This award is presented to a team selected by the Head Judge of ICM Problem E for excellence in using scientific theory and data in its modeling.</li>
    <li>Vilfredo Pareto was an Italian scholar, modeler and problem solver, who at various times was an engineer, sociologist, economist, political scientist, mathematician, and philosopher. He lived and worked in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The ICM Pareto Award for outstanding modeling in the Policy Modeling problem (ICM Problem F) honors the work and legacy of this famous social science problem solver. In particular for this award, the head judge seeks to highlight a paper that best models the more dynamic and challenging contextual human elements that make simplification or refinement of policy models so difficult. </li></ul>

      The Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) is the largest society in the world for professionals in the field of operations research (OR), management science (MS), and analytics. INFORMS has long recognized the importance of involving undergraduate students and faculty in an unscripted process of mathematical modeling whose problems contain many of the modern elements seen by its membership.  The MCM/ICM exemplifies these characteristics.  Consequently, INFORMS has been an active supporter of the MCM/ICM since its inception. <br><br>
      INFORMS carefully selects and designates a single Outstanding team from each of the six problems - A, B, C, D, E, F - as an INFORMS Outstanding winning team whose modeling and analyses best exemplify the style and content reflected in its membership's professional practice.   Each student  receives a letter of congratulations from the current INFORMS President and a complimentary one-year INFORMS student membership. Each associated faculty advisor receives a letter of congratulations and appreciation from the current INFORMS President, along with complimentary one-year access to the full suite of award-winning INFORMS journals. <br>
